# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project was to update a trip planning app called PlanMyTrip. The update includes a weather description of locations, new user action where they can filter locations based on their weather preference and the ability to create a route based on the cities in the itinerary.

## Resources
- Software: Python 3.7; Pandas, gmaps (GOOGLE API)

## Results
Delivery 1: Add weather description of locations based on a random sampling of lats and lngs. The result of this was a list of cities around the world with temperature data including weather description <br>
Delivery 2: Based on user input, the list of cities that came from delivery 1 was filtered out by user's preferred temperature (min and max). The result of this was ultimately a map view with markers of possible cities/hotels with the perfect weather as per the user's input <br>
Delivery 3: Using Google's Directions API, I was able to create a roundtrip route around four destinations in the same country. The route starts and ends in the same city and is applicable by driving, bicycling or walking.
